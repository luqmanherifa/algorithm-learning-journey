<!-- 
  Soal:

  You are given a string S of length N which encodes a non-negative number V in a binary form. two types of operations may be performed on it to modify its value;

  - if V is odd, substract 1 from it;
  - if V is even, divide it by 2.

  these operations are performed until the value of V becomes 0.

  for example, if string S = "011100", its value V initially is 28. the value of V would change as follows:

  - V = 28, which is even: divide by 2 to obtain 14;
  - V = 14, which is even: divide by 2 to obtain 7;
  - V = 7, which is odd: subtract 1 to obtain 3;
  - V = 6, which is even: divide by 2 to obtain 3;
  - V = 3, which is odd: subtract 1 to obtain 2;
  - V = 2, which is even: divide by 2 to obtain 1;
  - V = 1, which is odd: subtract 1 to obtain 0;

  Seven operations were required to reduce he value of V to 0.

  write a function:

  class Solution {public int solution(String S); }

  that, given a string S consisting of N characters containing a binary representation of the initial value V, returns the number of operations after which its value will become 0.

  examples:
  1. given S = "011100", the function should return 7. string S represents the number 28, which becomes 0 after seven operations, as explained above.

  2. given S = "111", the function should return 5. string S encodes the number V = 7. its value will change over the following five operations:

  - V = 7, which is odd: subtract 1 to obtain 6;
  - V = 6, which is even: divide by 2 to obtain 3;
  - V = 3, which is odd: subtract 1 to obtain 2;
  - V = 2, which is even: divide by 2 to obtain 1;
  - V = 1, which is odd: subtract 1 to obtain 0;

  3. given S = 11111010101111", the function should return 22.

  4. given string S consisting of "1" repeated 400,000 times, the function should return 799,999.

  write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
  - String S is made only of the characters '0' and/or '1';
  - N, which is the length of string S, is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000];
  - the binary representation is big-endian, i.e. the first character of string S corresponds to the most significant bit;
  - the binary representation may contain leading zeros.
